WIDGETS:

/xDirectory List class - it uses List* templates now

/remove CList, use extended List* templates

/reintroduce ColourText
  /Add ColourTextFind
  /Default to cText
  /SetFont no longer takes colour
  /TextOutAlligned places ColourTextFind in Font at last opportunity
  /Font colours override Container colours

/FreeTextOut
  -Add a callback to process
    -images
    -background
    -special font style chganges mid string
    -cursor

/WidgetText: Style add tsRotate, tsOblique

/Give WidgetText a published structure
  Typeface (really a FT2 typeface but hidden)
  Size
  YAdvance
  Style
  ColourFG
  ColourBG

-Go to String class

/-Container: don't support scrolling Children (too hard)

?Container:
  Add CanFocus
  in common processEvent
    Put CheckFocus there
    mouse event, call iseventmine there
    only call component event if
      mouse event and in their area OR locked there
      OR keyboard event and focussed there
    

Build a FileBrowser w Tree & Tabs

Build a spread sheet

Build a word processor

Build a Tree style note taker

Build a Scientific RPN logic calculator

Build an Application drawing tool

Support the WM clipboard
  / SDL
  ? X11 (currently fudged as a file)

/Move _Edit to its own module, allow multi line editing, with new line ...
  /Allow selection of some text
  /Mouse (x, y) to string index.
  ?common code with TextOutWrap() for word wrapping
  -allow esc sequence to change Font Size/Style/Colour (maybe not size)

/Make common List template functions for:
  -Components
  -TreeNodes
  -Forms
  ?-Directory
     add to current/beginning
  ?-(include Sort)
/Move Font Style rendering to WidgetsText. Including Bold Italic Outline Shadow Unnderline
/Add ClipRect (for non Texture Drivers mainly, maybe use in GridDrawCell)
  Apply to draw points/lines/bitmaps/rectangles/fills in Drivers
  Remove fudge clips (like in Text)
  
/Allow multiple Fonts cleanly/efficiently
xContainer: Add Event Preview (like Forms have)
/Check Events: put the forms together
?Check DrawRectangle etc
/Remove Rect* macros
?Move Actions to "of object" so Forms can (must) be in a class
Fix Hover (by Locking Event). ?Handle external to Widget?
/Add _Bitmap to every _Container:
  A horizontal strip of accessable images
  Render/Measure Text could substitute selected square sections from _Bitmap
  eg. Text = "\e5 some text", "Text/t\eA
  Include Bitmap param in Text render calls
  Include Bitmap in _Container
/Make ButtonRound its own widget type
  Circle radius = Min (Width, Height)
  No Hover
  Initiates to Transparent
ChangeTab -> /Clear KeyFocus, X initiate a Next message

============================= DONE
/ Allow Widgets without textures: Optional, maybe set by Driver?

Drivers:
  RenderTarget ()
    Add params x, y offset
    Use ClipRect (or ==) to limit drawing

Widgets:
  PrecessEvent:
    Don't create any textures
    Always draw direct to Window/Screen
    Drawing, accumulate x/y offset for each component
    No rendering required
    Only draw:
      Parents of Invalid components (until Solid) & only within the component's Rectangle
      Components with Invalid
      Their children


AUTO SIZE:

/ Solved by adding RectLock

Auto resize Containers when Form resizes
Height / Width changes
  Touching Child Containers either:
    a) Have Height / Width changed
    b) Preserve Height / Width but Move:
       In this case it effects toutching Children
Specify Container.Rect:
  x / y: 
    >=0: Relative to Left / Top
    <0: Relative to Right / Bottom
  Width / Height:
    >=0: Fixed
    <0: Can Vary
