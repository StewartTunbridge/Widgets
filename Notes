THINGS GOING FORWARD

Text: Currently relying on FreeType2 then crunching pixels. I'm thinking of putting text support in the WidgetDriver* so SDL can use its own TTF library.

Dropping X and Windows and relying on SDL for all. Is that a good way to go? With Wayland on the horizon, should it be supported OR let SDL handle Wayland.
